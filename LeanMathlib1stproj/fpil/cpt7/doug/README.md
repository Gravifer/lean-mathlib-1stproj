# doug[^doug]

A version of the Unix utility [`tree`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree),
which recursively prints the files in the current directory and its subdirectories,
indicating their tree structure using characters,
providing the option of Unicode box-drawing characters or their ASCII equivalents
when indicating directory structure.
<!-- ```bash
cd doug-demo
mkdir -p a/b/c
mkdir -p a/d
mkdir -p a/e/f
touch a/b/hello
touch a/d/another-file
touch a/e/still-another-file-again
``` -->

[^doug]: After the mighty Douglas Fir tree that adorns the west coast of North America;
of course, also a pun on Doug McIlroy's work on Unix tools.
