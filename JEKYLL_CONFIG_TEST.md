# Jekyll Configuration Test

This document explains how to test the Jekyll configuration locally to verify the fixes will work.

## Testing Locally

1. Navigate to the home_page directory:
   ```bash
   cd home_page
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Serve the site locally:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

4. Visit http://localhost:4000/lean-mathlib-1stproj/ to see the styled site

The fixes will take effect when merged to the main branch that GitHub Pages deploys from.
